# DECIDE - Debt Enterprise Control & Intelligence for DCA Excellence

## Problem Statement
Debt collection processes are often inefficient, lack transparency, and struggle with inconsistent recovery rates. Traditional methods rely heavily on manual decisions, leading to suboptimal allocation of resources, missed opportunities for early intervention, and difficulty in assessing the performance of Debt Collection Agencies (DCAs). There is a critical need for an intelligent, automated system that can guide decision-making, improve recovery outcomes, and ensure compliance through robust auditing.

## Solution Overview
The Debt Collection AI Decision Engine (DECIDE) is a prototype system designed to revolutionize debt collection by integrating machine learning, explainable AI, and an automated workflow. It provides data-driven recommendations for debt recovery actions, monitors Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and maintains a comprehensive audit log. The system aims to optimize recovery rates, enhance operational efficiency, and provide transparency in the decision-making process.

## Architecture
The DECIDE prototype is structured into several modular components:

*   **AI Module (`ai/`)**: Contains the machine learning model for recovery prediction, feature engineering logic, and explainability components (AI Decision Orchestrator).
    *   `ai/data/`: Stores synthetic and potentially real debt collection datasets.
    *   `ai/train.py`: Script for training and saving the machine learning model.
    *   `ai/model.py`: Functions for loading the trained model and making predictions.
    *   `ai/explainability.py`: Implements the `decide_action` function with XAI reasoning.
*   **Backend Module (`backend/`)**: Houses the core business logic, SLA engine, and audit logging.
    *   `backend/sla_engine.py`: Functions for checking SLA risks.
    *   `backend/audit.py`: Functions for initializing and appending to the audit log.
    *   `backend/decision_engine.py`: Orchestrates the entire decision-making workflow, integrating AI predictions, SLA checks, and audit logging.
*   **UI Module (`ui/`)**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the system.
    *   `ui/streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit application for the interactive dashboard.
*   **Pipeline Module (`pipeline/`)**: Placeholder for future data processing and MLOps pipelines.
    *   `pipeline/scheduler.py`: Placeholder for scheduling and automation logic.
*   **Notebooks Module (`notebooks/`)**: Stores development and demonstration notebooks.

## Key Features
*   **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates diverse datasets to simulate real-world debt collection scenarios.
*   **Machine Learning Model Training**: Trains a predictive model to forecast debt recovery outcomes.
*   **AI Decision Orchestrator**: Recommends optimal actions (e.g., 'Escalate immediately', 'Reassign to better DCA', 'Continue monitoring').
*   **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Provides clear, concise reasoning for each AI recommendation, enhancing trust and transparency.
*   **Simulated SLA Engine**: Automatically identifies and escalates cases at risk of SLA breaches.
*   **Comprehensive Audit Log**: Records all AI-driven decisions and actions for compliance and analysis.
*   **Interactive Colab UI**: A Streamlit-based user interface for monitoring KPIs, viewing case details, and exploring the audit trail.

## How to Run the Project
To run the DECIDE prototype, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository (if not already done):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AGSN-bit/DECIDE---Debt-Enterprise-Control-&Intelligence-for-DCA-Excellence.git
    cd DECIDE---Debt-Enterprise-Control-&Intelligence-for-DCA-Excellence
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed. Then install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib streamlit ipywidgets
    ```

3.  **Generate Synthetic Data:**
    The synthetic data (`synthetic_cases.csv`) is generated by the notebook. If running outside the notebook, you would typically have a script for this. For this prototype, the data is saved in `ai/data/synthetic_cases.csv` through the Colab notebook.

4.  **Train the Machine Learning Model:**
    Execute the training script to train the recovery prediction model:
    ```bash
    python ai/train.py
    ```
    This will save `recovery_prediction_model.joblib` and `model_feature_names.joblib` in the `ai/` directory.

5.  **Run the Streamlit UI:**
    Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
    ```
    A new tab in your web browser will open, displaying the DECIDE dashboard.

## Demo Flow
1.  **Dashboard Overview**: Upon launching the Streamlit app, you will see a dashboard displaying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as "Total Cases", "High-Risk Cases", and "Overall Predicted Recovery Rate".
2.  **Case Detail View**: Use the "Select a Case ID" dropdown to choose a specific debt collection case. The UI will dynamically update to show:
    *   **Original Case Information**: Details of the selected case.
    *   **AI Recommendation and Explanation**: The AI's suggested action, confidence score, and a detailed reasoning for that recommendation.
3.  **Audit Log**: Scroll down to view the "Audit Log" table. Each time you select a new case, a new entry will be recorded, capturing the timestamp, case ID, the full AI recommendation, decision type ('AI'), and the action taken. This demonstrates the system's transparency and audibility.
4.  **SLA Escalation**: Experiment with cases where `sla_days_remaining` is low (e.g., <= 7 days). Observe how the AI recommendation automatically triggers an 'Escalate immediately' action with high confidence and a specific reasoning related to SLA breach risk.
